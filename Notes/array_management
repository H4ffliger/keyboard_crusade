Miner management (HQ sets status to 0 every 70 turns. Miner needs to register every 69 turns)
One S will have the following interactions
When S is set to 0, 8 or 9 the miners know, they have to register again.
The first Miner which reads any of those three states sets the state to his miner status ID number
Miner01 = 1
Miner02 = 2
Miner03 = 4

Miner03 registers that he is alive and sets the number 0, 8 or 9 to it's status ID number. The status is now set to 4. The next miner Miner01 approaches and adds to this number the miner status ID number 2. The number is now 6. The Miner01 died and cant add his number to the Miner management array. The HQ checks this number and calculates the following 7 - the current status (7 - 6 = 1). The HQ know now that the miner with the status ID number 1 is dead or stuck. This way the miner has more information and will recreate the Miner01 and has now 3 miners again.
