- Carrier Strategy

Carrier has either intern goal to get resource or to bring them back to HQ
Goal to get resource is, when resource count is 0
It tries to read the next well from the array, then goes to it and extracts resource.

When it is full, it changes the goal to go to nearest HQ.
Once there, it transfers all material to HQ
